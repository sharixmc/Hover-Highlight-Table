# Hover Highlight Table

This HTML and CSS code creates a table with cells that change color on hover. The background color transitions quickly when the cursor is over the cell and returns to the original color more slowly when the cursor is removed.

## How to Use

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.

2. The table will be displayed with 20 rows and 20 columns.

3. Move the cursor over a cell to see it change color quickly.

4. When the cursor is removed, the cell's background color will transition back slowly.

## Code Overview

- The table is created using HTML and styled with CSS.

- JavaScript is used to add event listeners to each cell for mouseover and mouseout events.

- During a mouseover event, the background color of the cell changes quickly.

- During a mouseout event, a timeout function is used to slow down the transition back to the original color.

Feel free to customize the number of rows and columns or modify the colors according to your preferences.
